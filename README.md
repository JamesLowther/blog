**Hello!**

My name is James Lowther and welcome to my blog!

This is a space where I'll post interesting technical projects I'm working on, write-ups from security competitions, and any other general musings.

Here's a cool project to get you started: [[Projects/LED Matrix - ISS Tracker|LED Matrix - ISS Tracker]]
